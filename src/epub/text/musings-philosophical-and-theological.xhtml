				<p>Seated in his den, in the chill gloom of a winter twilight, comforting his stomach with hoarded bits of cheese and broad biscuits, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Grile thinketh unto himself after this fashion of thought:</p>

				<p>To eat biscuits and cheese before dining is to confess that you do not expect to dine.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h4>
				<p>“Once bit, twice shy,” is a homely saying, but singularly true. A man who has been swindled will be very cautious the second time, and the third. The fourth time he may be swindled again more easily and completely than before.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h4>
				<p>A four-footed beast walks by lifting one foot at a time, but a four-horse team does not walk by lifting one horse at a time. And yet you cannot readily explain why this is so.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h4>
				<p>Asked to describe the Deity, a donkey would represent him with long ears and a tail. Man’s conception is higher and truer: he thinks of him as somewhat resembling a man.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h4>
				<p>The bald head of a man is a very common spectacle. You have never seen the bald head of a woman.</p>

				<p>Piety, like small-pox, comes by infection. Robinson Crusoe, however, caught it alone on his island. It is probable that he had it in his blood.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VIII</h4>
				<p>The doctrine of foreknowledge does not imply the truth of foreordination. Foreordination is a cause antedating an event. Foreknowledge is an effect, not of something that is going to occur, which would be absurd, but the effect of its being going to occur.</p>

				<p>Old shoes are easiest, because they have accommodated themselves to the feet. Old friends are least intolerable because they have adapted themselves to the inferior parts of our character.</p>

			<section id="musings-philosophical-and-theological-11" epub:type="chapter">

				<p>Everybody professes to know that it would be difficult to find a needle in a haystack, but very few reflect that this is because haystacks seldom contain needles.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XIII</h4>
				<p>A man with but one leg is a better man than a man with two legs, for the reason that there is less of him.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="musings-philosophical-and-theological-14" epub:type="chapter">
				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XIV</h4>
				<p>A man without any legs is better than a man with one leg; not because there is less of him, but because he cannot get about to enact so much wickedness.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XV</h4>
				<p>When an ostrich is pursued he conceals his head in a bush; when a man is pursued he conceals his property. By instinct each knows his enemy’s design.</p>

			<section id="musings-philosophical-and-theological-17" epub:type="chapter">

				<p>In calling a man a hog, it is the man who gets angry, but it is the hog who is insulted. Men are always taking up the quarrels of others.</p>

				<p>It is better not to take a wife than to take one belonging to some other man: for if she has been a good wife to him she has adapted her nature to his, and will therefore be unsuited to yours. If she has not been a good wife to him she will not be to you.</p>

				<p>The most gifted people are not always the most favoured: a man with twelve legs can derive no benefit from ten of them without crawling like a centipede.</p>

				<p>A woman and a cow are the two most beautiful creatures in the world. For proof of the beauty of a cow, the reader is referred to an ox; for proof of the beauty of a woman, an ox is referred to the reader.</p>

				<p>There is reason to believe that a baby is less comely than a calf, for the reason that all kine esteem the calf the more comely beast, and there is one man who does not esteem the baby the more comely beast.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XXVIII</h4>
				<p>To judge of the wisdom of an act by its result is a very shallow plan. An action is wise or unwise the moment it is decided upon.</p>

				<p>I, Grile, have arranged these primal truths in the order of their importance, in the hope that some patient investigator may amplify and codify them into a coherent body of doctrine, and so establish a new religion. I would do it myself were it not that a very corpulent and most unexpected pudding is claiming my present attention.</p>
				<p>O, steaming enigma! O, savoury mountain of hidden mysteries! too long neglected for too long a sermon. Engaging problem, let me reveal the secrets latent in thy breast, and unfold thine occult philosophy! [<i>Cutting into the pudding.</i>] Ah! here, and here alone is⁠—[<i>Eating it.</i>]</p>
