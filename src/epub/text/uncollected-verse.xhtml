				<p>
					<span>The winds of heaven trample down the pines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or creep in lazy tides along the lea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lead the wild waters from the smitten rock.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or crawl with childish babble to the sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But why the tempests out of heaven blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or what the purpose of the seaward flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No man hath known, and none shall ever know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why seek to know? To follow nature up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the current of her course, why care?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vain is the toil; he’s wisest still who knows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All science is but formulated prayer⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prayer for the warm winds and the quickening rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prayer for sharp sickle and for laboring swain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To gather from the planted past the grain.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Basilica</h3>
				<p>
					<span>With aimless feet, along the verge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ocean, where the rocks emerge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I strolled, and watched the baffled surge.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In sheltered channels at my feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sleepy ripples crisping neat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slid in and out with sluicy beat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The groaning sea, wind-smitten white⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day, shot through with throbbing light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay palpitating on my sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From bloody death of stricken day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ocean’s leprous agony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My weary eyes I drew away,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To where the rocks the margin mar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of waters where the shadows are⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw the smiling of a star.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Imbedded deep in mossy green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A glinting gem with lustrous sheen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Burnt wondrous with a flame serene,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My soul grew drunken with its ray⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like liquid April filing May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its wing-light suffused the day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And day became⁠—with colors cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New-drowned in beauties manifold⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An opal chalice brimming gold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A silent music clove the air⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A spirit bent in worship there⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wish had wrought itself a prayer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O, if thy beauty, radiant stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be not rejected love alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By wooing skies upon thee thrown;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But rather a desire intense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appealing thus to human sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With more than human eloquence;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If so thou strivest to impart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The aspirations at thy heart⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pulsing a wish with every spark;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Give me to claim thy sacred ray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll bear the from thy shades away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set the in the perfect day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’ll niche thee in a shrine made fair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wondrous woods and metals rare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dim with amber-tinted air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sculpted work of quaint device,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gem-tinct with gleams of prismic ice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lamps antique of fabled price⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And droning troops of monkish bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With censers filled at spicy trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall minister on bended knees.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Grey darkness fell upon the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With hasty clutch my eager hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To snatch the gem from barren strand</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Essayed. When, Lo! with stiffened hair⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vision smit with baleful glare⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hope sharp-freezing to despair,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With heart compressed as in a vice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forehead bound with sudden ice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I grasped a hidden Cockatrice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O, with Heart of Stone with eyes of light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ivory throat of pallid white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And snaky folds concealed from sight⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With jeweled teeth, alas! and breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose touch to passion ministreth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweet-spiced with aromatic death!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No pen of poison, gall-immersed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of deadly sins can name thy worst;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or fitly curse thy race accursed.</span>
